# TestEngine
TestNJhin

Welcome to the open source test engine! 

This program is designed to take .csv formatted files, which are included in the repository. The program should be self explanatory for the most part.
To run the program, you'll need Python3, and I recommend using Visual Studio Code. While the test engine is good, there are some known flaws with it. 
However, we're constantly working on improvements! If you encounter any issues, feel free to message Kndjacob#5866 on Discord or post in the school Discord chat 
and tag me. 

Instructions for initial use:

1.) Download the TestEngine 3.zip

2.) Extract all files in a well-known directory

3.) Execute the program with a Python Compliler

4.) Use the program to navigate through your directory until you find the test bank you want to use.

5.) Select the test bank and number of questions you want to take.

6.) Enjoy!

Thanks for using the open source test engine!
